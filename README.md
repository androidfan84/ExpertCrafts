Updated by my for EW. Requires LlamaLibrary and Lisbeth.

Detailed instructions to come. Don't bother with the Botbase settings UI, it doesn't really work.

## Gatherers
Create a Lisbeth order for SkybuildersDolGrade4.json and just run it over and over again. You will likely need to restart it daily as it will not gather all the umbral items.

You can alternatively create an order for ExpertCraftsMats.json, which will gather all the mats needed to get all your crafters to 500,000 points, but won't be enough to get your gatherers done.

For fishing you should put Lisbeth in Diadem Expedition Mode and just leave it - it will get you all the fish you need.

Once finished with gatherers, dump all the mats in a retainer and run the crafter botbase.

## Crafters 
Run the botbase and go to sleep. It will craft 20 of each item and then turn them in, also running Kupo and buying items with scrips. The list of items to buy can be modified in ExpertCraftsSettings.cs.
